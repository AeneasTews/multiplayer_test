# Multiplayer Test

## Overview

The goals of this project will be to...  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...develop a working client-server model based multiplayer game with authenticated user accounts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...writing a "cheat-client" in order to gain a competitive advantage  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...developing anti-cheat capabilities in order to keep it fair

Furthermore, I would like to experiment with some optimization techniques for all the mentioned sub-topics, as optimizing networking is something I haven't had to do in the past.
